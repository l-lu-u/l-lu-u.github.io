*Art & Craft Workshop for Children, organised with [Burak Türköz](https://burakturkoz.gitlab.io/design-portfolio/) for [Kolibrí Festivaali](https://www.kolibrifestivaali.org/) 2025*

## Why are we making lanterns?

**A Lantern for Wishes** is an art and craft workshop at Sello Library, Espoo, organised by [Burak Türköz](https://burakturkoz.gitlab.io/design-portfolio/) and I (Lù Chén) for [Kolibrí Festivaali](https://www.kolibrifestivaali.org/) 2025.

Hence, we invite the children and their familities to make paper lantern together, and then decorate them with “amulets” that represent their past or future wishes. Feel free to bring any sentimental objects from home to decorate your lantern, or use the ones provided in the workshop. Bring your objects and wishes to life in this activity full of creativity and sensory play!
