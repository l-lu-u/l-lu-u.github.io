I'm Lu, a designer and artist currently based in Helsinki. Before moving to Finland, I studied computing 🧑‍💻 and have worked as an interaction and UX designer in Singapore. Yet, I became interested in the less-visible part of design, the systems and their interactions outsides the digital interface. 🌱 With the interest in communities and services, I started pursuing my study in design and media at Aalto University.

Like the life in the tropics 🌴 and the Nordics 🌲, I'm intrigued by the connections between seemingly contrasting things. Through (design) practices, I explore the surrounding world, communicate the findings, and thus connect the loose parts together. For me, design is the reflection-in-action, a bridge between vita activa (active life 🙌) and vita contemplativa (comtemplative life 🧠).

I'm open for jobs in service design, design research, and any initiatives aligning with my practices and interests.
