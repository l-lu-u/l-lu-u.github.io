During the spring of 2023, I completed my thesis about how participatory design might facilitate immigrants' civic engagement in Finland. By interviewing 8 designers who had experiences working with public agencies and participants with immigrant backgrounds, I acquired an overview about the applications of design in public service development, as well as designers' challenges.
