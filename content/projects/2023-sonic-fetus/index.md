## Question: What is growing...?

At the "Audiovisual Workshop" course in October 2023, I came across a corpus related to pregnancy on GitHub. Although the dataset is categorised under “science,” the entries contain the count of weeks, the name of a fruit, size, and weight. After some investigation, I found out that this corpus is comparing the growth of a human fetus to a type of fruit by weeks. This vivid and playful comparison is commonly used in obstetrics and gynaecology.

Combining the audio-reactive visuals with Stablediffusion, "sonic fetus" is my experiment to imagine this "fruity" analogy about human fetal development. The week count increments with every kick in the music while the fetus grows with the deep beat of the surdo and the "cry" of the cuica. From week 3 to week 40, the fetus transforms from a poppy seed to almost a pumpkin.

<!-- Originally, I planned to create a VJ tool for voguing and the ballroom scene. Yet, I came across [this corpus related to pregnancy on GitHub](github.com/dariusk/corpora/blob/master/data/science/pregnancy.json). Although the dataset is categorised under “science,” the entries contain the count of weeks, the name of a fruit, size, and weight. -->
