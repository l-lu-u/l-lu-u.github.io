                I studied information systems and have worked as an interaction and UX designer in 
                Singapore. In a side project with friends, we prototyped an urban farming platform 
                to promote cross-generational communication. This prototype won awards in a design 
                jam themed "design for a thriving community" by Adobe. After this, <span class="highlight">I became interested 
                    in the less-visible parts of design, the systems and their interactions beyond 
                    the digital interface.</span>  With the interest in communities and services, 
                I started pursuing my study in design and media at Aalto University. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Like the life in the tropics and the Nordics, I'm intrigued by the connections 
                between seemingly contrasting things. Through (design) practices, I explore the 
                surrounding world, study a certain phenomenon, communicate the findings, and thus 
                connect the loose parts together. <span class="highlight">For me, design is the reflection-in-action, a 
                bridge between <i>vita activa</i> (active life) and <i>vita contemplativa</i> 
                (comtemplative life). </span> 
            </p>

                I'm looking for jobs in service design and design research. If you would like to get

                In the autumn of 2021, I was working on a school project about designing advice 
                services for Finnish expatriates (as the design brief described). The word “expatriate”
                intrigued me a lot: who are expatriates? How are they different from immigrants? Am I 
                an expatriate - and why do I never feel this way?
