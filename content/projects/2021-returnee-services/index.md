The interests in examining immigration through the lens of design started in 2021. During the autumn semester, I was working on a course project about designing advice services for Finnish expatriates (as the design brief described). The word "expatriate" intrigued me: who are expatriates? How are they different from "immigrants"? (Am I also an expatriate? But why do I never feel like identifying myself this way?)
