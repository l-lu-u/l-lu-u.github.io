## About the Book

🗺 "Here, Not. *Dialogues on art and the making of here*" is an edited collection of conversations, photographic work, and creative writing, that investigate how arts and culture address belonging, identity and access in the urban spaces of Helsinki.

This publication is part of Micol Curatolo's MA thesis project. Thanks to Micol (her inspirations and her trust), I had this opportunity to join this journey with her and experiment with the “boundaries” and “layers” between text and images.

## On Design: Layout and Borders

[![Lù on Design](./images/HereNot-Design.png)](./images/HereNot-Design.png)

Layout work is a work with borders.  

To layout, we set up the margins, gutters, bleeds, and other guides to bind the text and images within these borders, yet sometimes we let them flow over the lines. 

We take this journey with a bundle of maps: at the beginning of each chapter, we can find lines that extracted from certain geographic locations. Between page and page, I applied gradient to allow some light to leak through an imagined crack on the border. In Here, Not., I wish that by playing with the ambiguity of dividing lines, I have managed to depict the energetic flows within the conversations and writings.
