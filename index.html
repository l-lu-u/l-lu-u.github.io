            <p>
                During the spring of 2023, I completed my thesis about 
                how participatory design might facilitate immigrants' civic engagement in Finland. By interviewing
                8 designers who had experiences working with public agencies and participants with immigrant backgrounds,
                I acquired an overview about the applications of design in public service development, as well as designers' challenges.

                The interests in examining immigration through the lens of design started in 2021.
                During the autumn semester, I was working on a course project about designing advice 
                services for Finnish expatriates (as the design brief described). The word "expatriate" 
                intrigued me: who are expatriates? How are they different from "immigrants"? 
                (Am I also an expatriate? But why do I never feel like identifying myself this way?)

                With these questions, I started to pay attention to the topic of immigration in the following projects
                during my study or in everyday life. For example, in an introductory course about Information Design, when I 
                investigating a dataset about the monthly number of jobseekers and vacancies in the Healthcare sector in Finland, 
                 I noticed a possible link between jobseeking and the immigration:
