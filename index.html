            <h1> Lu / 璐 (Pinyin: L&ugrave;; “fine jade”)</h1>
            <p>I'm Lu, a designer and artist currently based in Helsinki. Before moving to Finland, 
                I attained a bachelor's degree of computing and have been working as an interaction 
                and UX designer in Singapore. In a side project with friends, we designed and 
                prototyped an urban farming platform to connect different generations together. 
                This prototype won the an award in a design jam themed “design for a thriving 
                community” hosted by Adobe. Yet, I became interested in the less-visible parts of 
                design, the systems and their interactions beyond the digital interface. With the 
                interest in communities and services, I started pursuing my study in design and 
                media at Aalto University. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Like the life in the tropics and the Nordics, I'm intrigued by the connections 
                between seemingly contrasting things. Through (design) practices, I explore the 
                surrounding world, study a certain phenomenon, communicate the findings, and thus 
                connect the loose parts together. For me, design is the reflection-in-action, a 
                bridge between vita activa (active life) and vita contemplativa (comtemplative life).  
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm looking for jobs in service design and design research. If you would like to get
