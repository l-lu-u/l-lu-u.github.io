                I studied computing 🧑‍💻 and have worked as an interaction and UX designer in 
                Singapore. Yet, <span class="highlight">I became interested 
                    in the less-visible parts of design, the systems and their interactions beyond 
                    the digital interface.</span>  With the interest in communities and services, 
                I started pursuing my study in design and media at Aalto University.

            <p>
                Like the life in the tropics 🌴 and the Nordics 🌲, I'm intrigued by the connections 
                between seemingly contrasting things. Through (design) practices, I explore the 
                surrounding world, communicate the findings, and thus connect the loose parts together. 
                <span class="highlight">For me, design is the reflection-in-action, a 
                bridge between <i>vita activa</i> (active life 🙌) and <i>vita contemplativa</i> 
                (comtemplative life 🧠). </span> 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm open for jobs in <span class="highlight">service design</span>, <span class="highlight">design research</span>,
                 and <span class="highlight">any initiatives aligning with my practices and interests.</span>

            <p>燕燕于飛 - Immigration, and Re-imaginations of (collective) identity (2023)</p>
            <p>
                In the autumn of 2021, I was working on a school project about designing advice 
                services for Finnish expatriates (as the design brief described). The word "expatriate"
                intrigued me a lot: who are expatriates? How are they different from "immigrants"? Am I 
                an expatriate - and why do I never feel this way? 
            </p>
