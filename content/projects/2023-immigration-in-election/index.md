While in the Information Design minor studies (2023), I tried to visualise election parties and candidates views on immigration on voting compass.

## Question: What are we talking about when talking about immigration?

From the parliamentary election in April to the new cabinet formation in mid-June, immigration policy has been one of the topical issues in 2023 Finnish government negotiation. How do Finnish election parties and their candidates view immigration? What are the major conflicts between parties?

With access to the open data from the Yle voting compass, this information design project attempts to unpack the complex discussion topics about immigration and remind us of some potential cognitive biases. 

1. candidates’ opinions on work-based immigration;
2. candidates’ opinions on 4 immigration-related statements;
3. candidates’ opinions and the distribution within and across parties
4. frequent topics in parties’ political stances in immigration based on a qualitative analysis
