*service design -> expatriate, or immigrant?*

The interests in examining immigration through the lens of design started in 2021. During the autumn semester, I was working on a course project about designing advice services for Finnish expatriates (as the design brief described). The term "expatriate" intrigued me the most: who are expatriates? And how are they different from "immigrants"? 

(Also, am I also an expatriate? But why do I never feel like identifying myself this way?)
